                    Creating physical, emotional, and mental space by focusing on natural needs, enjoying unnecessary pursuits in moderation, and avoiding unnatural desires. Natural needs have clear limits. You can only eat so much food before you're no longer hungry. You can only drink so much water before you're no longer thirsty. You need only so much warmth before you're no longer cold. There’s only so much a shelter has to provide in order to shelter you. Take time to notice the peace that comes when hunger is gone and thirst is satisfied.

                    Natural desires can be pursued in unnecessary ways. You can drink soda to quench your thirst. You can eat highly processed foods to end your hunger. However, these actions often have unwanted effects on your physical and mental wellbeing, and they can create new cravings.

                <p>
                    Unnatural desires—those not needed for survival, such as the desire for luxury, fame, excessive money, exotic travel, or endless social media scrolling—have no natural limit. There's always thirst for more money. There's always a need to acquire more fame, to impress more people, to gain ever more praise and maintain your reputation. There's always a craving to scroll more. Engaging in unnatural pursuits means choosing to remain forever thirsty.

                    My house does not have to be a palace—it just has to be safe, clean, and welcoming. The way I dress does not have to be fancy—it just has to be neat. I don't need elaborate foods and drinks—I just need something nutritious and reasonably tasty. I don't need to scroll through social media for hours each day—I just need to meet with friends once a week. I don't need to spend hours browsing YouTube and random news to stay informed—I just need to check a few highly curated sources once a week or two.

                    At least eight hours. Keeping a steady schedule. No light or sound, to the best degree possible. Being careful with liquid intake before sleep to prevent nighttime wake-ups. Relaxing bedtime routine: stretching, tea, and a calming book. If I can't sleep, I simply read until I feel very tired, using an e-reader with very warm and dim backlight, lights off, to encourage sleepiness.

                        <em>We reflect on the effort that brought us this food and consider how it comes to us.<br/>
                        We reflect on our virtue and practice, and whether we are worthy of this offering.<br/>
                        We regard greed as the obstacle to freedom of mind.<br/>
                        We regard this meal as medicine to sustain our life.<br/>
                        For the sake of enlightenment we now receive this food.<br/></em>

                        "We chant this verse to remind ourselves that eating is a spiritual practice, not just a way to fill our stomachs and satisfy our desires. We acknowledge that we eat to support our life, but also affirm the important spiritual meaning of the meal. We eat to keep this body in good shape and also to renew our bodhi-mind, our aspirations to practice according to the Buddha's teaching."<br/>

                    Food cooked at home, as unprocessed as possible. At least 1.4g of protein per kg of body weight per day—ideally 2.2g if currently engaging in intense physical exercise. At least 24g of high-quality protein per meal. A healthy portion of vegetables and other micronutrient sources. 250ml of water per hour during the first 10 hours awake. An additional 250ml of water for each hour of exercise. No sugar. No alcohol.

As he raised his arms, he used to say to himself, "Courage now, Crates, this is for the good of your eyes and of your whole body; and there will come a day when you will see these people, who are now laughing at you, become shrivelled up by illness, and then they will account you happy and reproach themselves for their idleness!"<br/>

                    Following the approach outlined in: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaA3qD1EAqg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaA3qD1EAqg</a>. The current implementation involves two zone 2 cardio sessions and one HIIT cardio session, all on elliptical bike. Aside from the cardio sessions I engage in four resistance training sessions centered around compound movements: push-ups, pull-ups/chin-ups, squats, and core strengthening. All sessions are 20 minutes.
