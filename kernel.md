# Kernel — What do I do with my life?

## Practice

> "There is no way to Nirvana, Nirvana is the way." — Thich Nhat Hanh  
> "There is no Nirvana outside of your practice." — Shunryu Suzuki, in "Zen mind. Beginner's mind."

### Physical

1. **Space**

    > "It is not the man who has little, but the man who craves more, that is poor." — Seneca

      Creating physical, emotional, and mental space by focusing on natural needs, enjoying unnecessary pursuits in moderation, and avoiding unnatural desires. Natural needs have clear limits. You can only eat so much food before you're no longer hungry. You can only drink so much water before you're no longer thirsty. You need only so much warmth before you're no longer cold. There’s only so much a shelter has to provide in order to shelter you. Take time to notice the peace that comes when hunger is gone and thirst is satisfied.

    Natural desires can be pursued in unnecessary ways. You can drink soda to quench your thirst. You can eat highly processed foods to end your hunger. However, these actions often have unwanted effects on your physical and mental wellbeing, and they can create new cravings.

      Unnatural desires—those not needed for survival, such as the desire for luxury, fame, excessive money, exotic travel, or endless social media scrolling—have no natural limit. There's always thirst for more money. There's always a need to acquire more fame, to impress more people, to gain ever more praise and maintain your reputation. There's always a craving to scroll more. Engaging in unnatural pursuits means choosing to remain forever thirsty.

    My house does not have to be a palace—it just has to be safe, clean, and welcoming. The way I dress does not have to be fancy—it just has to be neat. I don't need elaborate foods and drinks—I just need something nutritious and reasonably tasty. I don't need to scroll through social media for hours each day—I just need to meet with friends once a week. I don't need to spend hours browsing YouTube and random news to stay informed—I just need to check a few highly curated sources once a week or two.

2. **Sleep**
   
    > "The day starts with evening Zazen and sleep is part of 24h practice." — Kosho Uchiyama

    At least eight hours. Keeping a steady schedule. No light or sound, to the best degree possible. Being careful with liquid intake before sleep to prevent nighttime wake-ups. Relaxing bedtime routine: stretching, tea, and a calming book. If I can't sleep, I simply read until I feel very tired, using an e-reader with very warm and dim backlight, lights off, to encourage sleepiness.


3. **Diet**

    > *We reflect on the effort that brought us this food and consider how it comes to us.*  
    > *We reflect on our virtue and practice, and whether we are worthy of this offering.*  
    > *We regard greed as the obstacle to freedom of mind.*  
    > *We regard this meal as medicine to sustain our life.*  
    > *For the sake of enlightenment we now receive this food.*
    > 
    > "We chant this verse to remind ourselves that eating is a spiritual practice, not just a way to fill our stomachs and satisfy our desires. We acknowledge that we eat to support our life, but also affirm the important spiritual meaning of the meal. We eat to keep this body in good shape and also to renew our bodhi-mind, our aspirations to practice according to the Buddha's teaching."
    > 
    > — Shohaku Okumura, in "Living by Vow"
   
    Food cooked at home, as unprocessed as possible. At least 1.4g of protein per kg of body weight per day—ideally 2.2g if currently engaging in intense physical exercise. At least 24g of high-quality protein per meal. A healthy portion of vegetables and other micronutrient sources. 250ml of water per hour during the first 10 hours awake. An additional 250ml of water for each hour of exercise. No sugar. No alcohol.

4. **Exercise**

    > He was ugly to behold, and when he carried out his exercises, people would laugh at him. As he raised his arms, he used to say to himself, "Courage now, Crates, this is for the good of your eyes and of your whole body; and there will come a day when you will see these people, who are now laughing at you, become shrivelled up by illness, and then they will account you happy and reproach themselves for their idleness!"

    > — From "Diogenes the Cynic: Sayings and Anecdotes, With Other Popular Moralists" – A new translation by Robin Hard – Oxford Classics

    Following the approach outlined in: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaA3qD1EAqg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaA3qD1EAqg). The current implementation involves two zone 2 cardio sessions and one HIIT cardio session, all on elliptical bike. Aside from the cardio sessions I engage in four resistance training sessions centered around compound movements: push-ups, pull-ups/chin-ups, squats, and core strengthening. All sessions are 20 minutes.


### Emotional

1. **Zazen**

   > "Zazen is the Dharma, the Dharma is Zazen." — the basis of Soto Zen, from Kosho Uchiyama's "Opening the hand of thought"

    The practice of simply being: just sitting, just breathing, just walking—without desire or expectation.

    (i) Sit, ideally facing a wall, (ii) with open eyes, looking a short distance ahead, (iii) in a position where you won't fall asleep, while (iv) belly breathing. Ideally for at least 20 minutes.

    Whenever a thought captures your attention, neither push it away nor entertain it. The desire to have no desire is still a desire. The expectation to have no thoughts in your mind is still an expectation. When derailed, simply return to just sitting with your bones and muscles, letting the thought pass along. A good analogy is the sky, which lets clouds pass by without interfering, without identifying with any of them, without attaching to any of them, and without pushing any of them away.

    As it may be very difficult to realize when you have drifted into thought, you may count your breath. While focusing on your belly, count your inhale as 1, your exhale as 2, and so on until 10, then start again. Let your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations just be, and continue to count your breath. When you overcount or lose count, simply start again from 1—this is great, it means you've noticed a mental drift. The goal is the practice of returning to just breathing itself. Nothing more.

    Whenever you have time throughout the day, return to your breath, even for one breath. Or return to just walking if you are walking. Count your steps the same way you would count your breath, while focusing on your feet.

    As an alternative to Zazen, I highly recommend Prajna, as described by John Vervaeke here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdL9Yd0lB_k&list=PLND1JCRq8VujAHvDA482SXF1cJTQrwlx3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdL9Yd0lB_k&list=PLND1JCRq8VujAHvDA482SXF1cJTQrwlx3).


2. **Metta**

    > After the Japanese attack on the American base at Pearl Harbor, circumstances obliged the disciple and his master to part company. "We will certainly lose the war,” Kodo Sawaki said at their leave-taking. “Our homeland will be destroyed, our people annihilated ... and this may be the last time we see one another. Nevertheless, love all mankind regardless of race or creed.”
    >
    > — Excerpt from Taisen Deshimaru's "The Voice of the Valley"

    "Beings are numberless, I vow to free them." The first bodhisattva vow speaks to freeing beings from suffering, through metta, karuna, and mudita: loving-kindness, compassion, and sympathetic joy.

    Metta, i.e. loving-kindness, is beatifully described by John Vervake as the intention to realize the moreness of someone, in both senses of the word "to realize": to discover and to make real. This means both (i) discovering that the other person is more than you thought, and (ii) helping their potential become real.

    When making a presentation, don't think "I want to make a great impression." Think "I want to help these people by giving them useful information." Imagine your brother or close friend asking: "What have you learned from your experience? Please tell me so I can learn something and make my life better." Then think "I want to realize the moreness of that person" and respond with that spirit. When you aim to impress, you feel anxious—the focus is on you. When you aim to help others benefit from what you've discovered, you feel warm inside—the focus is on them.

   Second, karuna—compassion. When someone becomes angry and won't listen to reason, realize that person is suffering. Instead of shouting back, help them vent. Ask them to tell you more. Accept that they suffered without agreeing with or encouraging their views. "I understand that was a miserable experience for you. Tell me more about it." Don't encourage their views by saying "Yes, they're total jerks." Simply respond with "I understand how you're feeling." When they try to convince you of something, gently redirect the converation back to expressing their feelings. Listen and accept the emotions as they are. If their views aren't challenged or encouraged—if the emotion is simply vented and accepted—the person will eventually calm down. After that happens, switch subjects, make tea for instance.

    Trying to convince an enraged person is useless and only makes them feel more misunderstood, leaving you both distressed. You can't rationally change their mind, but you can help them vent and feel better inside. Again, the focus shifts outside, from "I want to win this argument" to "I understand this person is suffering, and I can alleviate some of that suffering by listening compassionately." This leaves you with warmth inside and gives them a clearer mind, free of vented rage, alongside a most important sense of belonging and being understood.

4. **Savoring and Having Fun**

    > "Send me a pot of cheese, so that I may have a feast when I care to." — Epicurus

    My bedtime routine involves 5-10mins of full body stretching, followed by warm calming tea and reading a book.

3. **Chores. Mindful and energetic engagement in chores.**

    > The Chanyuan also says, "Put your awakened mind to work, making a constant effort to serve meals full of variety that are appropriate to the need and the occasion, and that will enable everyone to practice with their bodies and their minds with the least hindrance."
    >
    >  — Excerpt from Kosho Uchiyama's "How to cook your life"

### Mental

1. **Internalizing Socrates**

    I like to group this into what I call **the core hour: 20min sport, 20min zazen, 20min Plato**. I usually do them in this order, spreaded throughout the day. Sport in the morning, zazen in the middle of the day, Plato in the evening.


2. Studying and experiencing Nature

3. **Journaling**

    I am currently engaged in multiple forms of journaling. First of all, I am engaged in writing and continuously updating this commonplace. This is a form of hypomnemata, of continuously repeating, reinvestigating and refining my core principles.

5. Therapy

### Social

Spending time with:

1. Family
2. Friends
3. Community

    Getting a job which contributes to society at large and engaging in the job with the mindful intent to aid the community.
   
4. Nature

    Taking a walk in a park, by a lake or in a forest.

## Some of the theory behind the practice

### Knowledge

Having things (including abilities, physical or mental traits, etc.) is useless if you don't know how to use them and damaging if you don't use them rightly. If you have beauty and you don't know how to make use of it, others will exploit it at your expense. In order to use them rightly knowledge is required. You can burrow it in some scenarios, but in most scenarios, especially those specific to your particularities, you have to generate the knowledge yourself via understanding.

### Understanding

I would say that the trajectory of a falling rock is grounded in the laws of physics. And that the same laws of physics explain the trajectory of every falling rock. I would say someone understands how rocks fall, if he is able to model these laws of physics which ground and explain the trajectories of falling rocks. And as proof that he modeled them rightly, as proof that he understands how rocks fall, he would be able to generate, simulate or predict trajectories of falling rocks, using his model which approximates the laws. Because of our understanding of how things move, you are not allowed to place bets at the roulette once the ball has been launched.

It is important to note the two properties that the laws of physics manifest with regard to the falling rocks: they ground and they explain. It is important to note that the trajectories of falling rocks are grounded in the laws of physics, to note that the laws of physics manifest themselves in the trajectory of every falling rock, because noting this enables us to model these laws. That is, since the laws of physics manifest themselves in the trajectory of every rock, we can model them by abstracting out that which is common among a large set of instances of rocks being thrown. And it is important to note that these laws of nature explain the trajectories of falling rocks, and use that as a criteria to validate our understanding. That is, our understanding (our model) is as good inasmuch as it can explain (or generate or simulate or predict) the trajectories of falling rocks.

### Nature

Now, it seems to me very desirable to push this to the max: model that which grounds and explains every thing, so we can understand everything. For the purposes of the current work, I will refer to that which grounds and explains every thing, the nature of all things, as Nature. Let's reiterate the two properties it features:

1. Nature grounds every thing. Every thing is grounded in Nature. Nature partakes in everything. Nature manifests itself in every thing; the same way the laws of physics (the laws of Nature) manifest themselves in the trajectory of every falling rock, the same way the psychological archetype of Anger manifests itself through every angry individual, the same way biological evolution manifests itself in every adapted species. Nature is that which is common among all things. Nature is the through-line which goes through everything, it is that which binds our universe into a coherent whole.

2. Since Nature is that which explains all things, it is not itself any thing. Note how, that which grounds and explains all trajectories of falling rocks, is not itself a trajectory of a rock which is falling, but rather, the laws of physics. That which grounds and explains all instances of people being angry, is not an instance of someone being angry, but a psychological archetype. That which grounds and explains all adaptive features, such as quickness or wit, is not itself and adaptive feature such as quickness or wit, it is the process of biological evolution. Similarly, that which grounds and explains all things, is not itself a thing; it is that which grounds and explains all those things.

Let me dwell on this second point because I find it so awesome. That which grounds and explains all beings is not itself any being. That which grounds and explains all phenomena is not itself a phenomena. That which grounds and explains all ideas is not itself an idea. That which grounds and explains both good and bad is not itself good or bad, it is that which grounds and explains both of them. That which grounds and explains all things which are caused is not itself a thing which is caused. That which grounds and explains all things which observe and all things which are observed is not something which observes or something which is observed. That which grounds and explains all intelligible things is not itself an intelligible thing. So you cannot understand it.

Now let me reiterate everything and focus on the first point a bit more. In general, the way you would find the law(s) of physics which govern the trajectories of falling rocks, goes something like this: you throw out hundreds of rocks up into the sky and at a distance, and then you try to look for that which is common among all the trajectories of these falling rocks. You may observe at first that: (i) all rocks go up at the beginning, (ii) afterwards, the ascent slowly comes to a halt and then (iii) the rock proceeds to travel towards the ground faster and faster. Thus, you notice that the trajectory forms somewhat of an arch, and then you may discover that you can model this pattern with a polynomial function. In the end, this polynomial function servers as a model of the natural law which governs the trajectory of falling rocks.

Now let's do the same with a human being.

"The Dao named Dao is not the true Dao", the Nature of all things that you can name, the Nature of all things about which you can say something, is not the true Nature of all things. Nature, which binds our universe into a coherent whole, is that which affords the subject-object interaction, it is Nature which affords observation and understanding. We can never look at Nature because we look through Nature. It is Nature which binds into a coherent whole both the subject and the object in order to make observations possible and inteligibility exist. Because we understand the universe through and by means of Nature, we can not look at it, we only look through it and by means of it. In this sense I like John Vervaeke's definition of the Good as the promise that the map matches the terrain. That is, the promise that the subjective and the objective are deeply bound together, that Nature affords intelligibility. Because our understanding presupposes Nature, we can never step aside and look at nature rather than through it. In this sense, I love the Buddhist idea that you are already saved by the Buddha (that which is one with everything, a metaphor for Nature in this context, not a reference to the historical Buddha), because in some sense, it is true that you are already completely enmeshed within the Nature of all things, everything you do, you do through Nature and by means of it. Your very being is completely by Nature and living within the Nature of all things, so there is nothing left to do. "With nothing to attain, the boddhisattva depends on prajna-paramita". There is nothing to atain, we just sit Zazen.

At an absolute level, there is nothing to attain. At least no goal which can be formulated as a proposition. But does not mean that we don't have desires and that we should not avoid pain for instance. It just means that in terms of goals there are no absolute ones and we're just left off with our human goals. As per the previous paragraph, we also can't gain absolute understanding, so let's continue our discussion by focusing on local goals and local understanding.


### Goals

Maybe we don't need to understand everything, maybe we just need to understand how to act in order to fulfil our goal. But what goal? Minimizing pain would be a straight answer. However, if I really just wanted to avoid pain I would sit in my room all day. I don't do that, and nobody I know does that. I also like to practice sports and eat at restaurants. I also like to experience pleasure. So the goal might be to minimize pain while maximizing pleasure. However, there is no straightforward way to do that. Again, if I want to experience the pleasure of reaching the top of a mountain, I have to undergo significant physical hardship and pain while exposing myself to the risk of facing a bear in the wild. If I want to avoid future pain by undergoing a medical treatment, consisting in a surgery, going through recovery and following a restricted diet for a while, that certainly isn't pleasureable. In some circumstances I can optimize both goals, but often one of the goals can only be optimized at the expense of the other. And I've found no clear way to balance them as of yet.

And we've not yet considered the desire to survive and reproduce. That comes in conflict both with minimizing pain and with maximizing pleasure. The clearest example I can think of is having a child. Raising a child, as far as I've been informed, is far from pleasurable and it can be very physically and mentally demanding. You don't get to sleep well, you don't get to eat well, you're sick all the time, your finances take a hit, vacations are not an option anymore and there's a lot of added responsibility. Aside from optimizing pain, pleasure and survival there's also the need to live a meaningful life. You may want to stand up for what is right in the face of adversity, but that may come at the cost of reduced pleasure, increased pain and a reduced chance of survival. Pursuing any vocation seriously requires significant effort and can be physically and mentally demanding while stripping away the time you could dedicate to your family and to pleasureable activities.

As far as I understand myself, I don't have a clear goal. Sometimes I choose to undergo pain in order to experience pleasure. Sometime I sacrifice pleasure in order to avoid pain. Sometimes I voluntarily give up pleasure and undergo pain in order to survive. Sometimes I take risks that threaten my survival in order to experience pleasure or to avoid pain. Sometimes I engage in meaningful pursuits at the expense of all other goals. Sometimes I give up on meaningful pursuits so that I can focus on surviving and avoiding pain. So, I can never understand Nature, I can never understand everything. I though I could understand how to reach my goal, but I can't define my goal, I have multiple conflicting goals.


### Transjectivity

Let's suppose for a moment that I don't have multiple conflicting goals. Let's suppose I have a single goal and let's try to optimize that. For simple goals, such as making a cup of coffee, a procedure and easily be optimized. However, for more encompassing goals, such as being a loving individual, there is no procedure that one can follow.

1. The way you manifest your love towards your wife is different from the way you should manifest your love for your child. Both of these, in turn are different from the way you would manifest love towards a coworker; you would not kiss your coworker goodnight. Love also manifests in completely different ways towards your parents, people on the street, brothers and sisters, other relatives, the cashier you interact with, money, fame, your pet, some work of art, etc.
 
2. Within the context of a single individual, sometimes you have to be accepting, to let the other manifest the way it finds suitable, e.g. let your friend pursue a career he would love but you'd not consider optimal. At other times however, you have to push against the other, in order to prevent him from damaging himself, e.g. prevent your friend from doing drugs.

3. Even if you consider the very restricted case, of tackling a single specific context with regards to a single specific individual, e.g. eating dinner with your wife, the answer is still not a procedural one. You can't do the same thing forever. Sometimes you may tell jokes during the dinner, but she will soon grow tired of your jokes, hence, at times, you might want to discuss other things, or propose to eat out, or look at old pictures together and discuss them while eating.

It is impossible to optimize such a procedure, because for a given subject (in this case, you), the procedure has to at least be optimized to encompass all objects with which the subject interacts, across all circumstances and across all moments in time. It is impossible to even list all those scenarios, let alone optimize for all of them. And this is if you want to pursue optimizing love for a single subject (in this case, for you), if you want to optimize a form of manifesting love which works for all subjects, that adds a whole other degree of complexity. Because of love's transjectivity, it can never be fully articulated or understood. Love is just an example, there is a plethora of similar goals. To list a handful: to be a good cook, to be a good musician, to be a good programmer, to be a good mathematician, to be a good writer.

So, I can never understand Nature, I can never understand everything. I though I could understand how to reach my goal, but I can't define my goal, I have multiple conflicting goals. And on top of that, now I've found out that even if I did chose to focus on a single goal such as being a loving individual, there's no way in which I could every properly optimize it anyway.


### Relevance Realization

even if you only chose a single subject a single object a single situation at a single point in time, there's the issue that realizing what is relevant and that cannot be computed, so you're always biased and susceptible to self destructive self-deceptive behavior.


### Computational Irreducibility

Even if you did know all the relevant factors, there's computational irreducibility.


### Conclusion on knowledge

We're just finite computational machines making miss-informed short-sighted poorly-optimized decisions towards ambiguous goals which are in conflict both internally and externally.


### So what is there to be done?

Instead of focusing on making the right decision and achieving and having things (e.g. fame, money, titles)



## Some books to flesh out the theory and the knowledge required for practice a bit more

These are sorted in a curriculum. This first section contains only very short, easy to read books, covering the very basic principles: (i) the realization that the life full of wealth and fame alone is not meaningful, (ii) the very basics about cultivating loving relationships that are meaningful and (iii) the very basics of getting to know yourself, building a meaningful relationship with yourself and investigating your cognitive patterns.

1. The Death of Ivan Ilyich - Leo Tolstoy
2. True Love - Thich Nhat Hanh
3. The power of focusing - Ann Weiser Cornell

This second section is a bit more in depth and technical, but still accesible and restricted to three books as well, covering the three layers: physical, emotional and mental. However, it should be mentioned that these books are not restricted to a specific domain, all of them aid in physical, emotional and mental health at the same time, they just come from different angles. The first tackles of course, physical health, the second goes a bit deeper into the impact of relationships and how to cultivate them, and the third is an introduction to Buddhist philosophy as a way of life.

1. Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body - Andrew Huberman
2. The Good Life: Lessons from the World's Longest Scientific Study of Happiness - Robert Waldinger
3. The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching - Thich Nhat Hanh

This last section is very in depth, technical, and at points mystical. I did my best to sort them in an order which introduces concepts gradually, such that the mysticism is reduced as much as possible.

1. John Vervaeke - Awakening from the Meaning Crisis
2. What is ancient philosophy? - Pierre Hadot
3. The inner citadel - Pierre Hadot
4. The Wisdom of Hypatia - Bruce J MacLennan
5. Opening the hand of thought - Kosho Uchiyama
6. Living by vow - Shohaku Okumura
7. Plato - Complete works -- Maybe starting with Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, Phaedo, Meno, Lysis, Charmides, Laches, Alcibaldes, Symposium
8. Dialectic and Dialogue: Plato's Practice of Philosophical Inquiry - Francisco Gonzalez



## Summary

If I were to summarize everything I wrote here, it would be an adaptation of Kodo Sawaki's message to Taisen Deshimaru: "Life is full of suffering, and we make it worse with our foolishness, nevertheless, love humanity with all your heart." Similar to Viktor Frankl, I believe that amid all this suffering, we can engage in acts of caring that can bring meaning to our life and make life worth living. So when suffering occurs, we just continue our practice. As Dogen said: "Just practice."

> The way of the Buddha is endless, I vow to see it through.

Just continue walking. Just walk. Just practice.
