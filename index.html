            Worked on an Automated Vouchering Tool project aimed at extracting data from invoices and invoice-like documents in order to be compared to General Ledgers. My contribution included research and development on machine sub-projects such as: signature detection and matching, logo detection and matching, page deskewing and handwritten number extraction. I have also coordinated the research and development for an Explainable AI platform hosted on the cloud for which I have proposed an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03896">exemplar synthetization framework</a>.
