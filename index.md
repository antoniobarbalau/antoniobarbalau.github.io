## Academic Experience

### Computer Science PhD

**[University of Bucharest](https://fmi.unibuc.ro/)** *2019 - 2024*

[Thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WDd3nGCstSEZLojTLxETx2K_oXMwlCUa/view?usp=sharing) on “Novel Approaches for Weakly Supervised and Self-Supervised Learning” featuring an oral presentation at NeurIPS (1% acceptance rate), a CVPR, a CVIU, an ECML-PKDD, an EMNLP and a NeurIPS datasets track paper, reaching 500 citations before the final defense.


### Scientific Committee Member

**[AI Olympiad, Romania](https://olimpiada-ai.ro/)** *2024 - Present*

Engaging in the training, evaluation and selection of the IOAI and IAIO Romanian team s since the very first year these olympiads took shape.


### Teaching Assistant

**[University of Bucharest](https://fmi.unibuc.ro/)** *2017 - 2022*

Most notably: Machine Learning and Deep Learning for the AI Master and Artificial Intelligence for the undergraduate level.


### Research Assistant

**[University of Bucharest](https://fmi.unibuc.ro/)** *2020 - 2022*

Involved in research projects covering various topics including authorship identification and video anomaly detection. Those projects ran in partnership with various companies and universities including Bitdefender, Tremend, BRD and the University of Central Florida.


### Short-Term Scholar

**[University of Central Florida](https://www.cs.ucf.edu/research/center-for-research-in-computer-vision-lab/)** *May 2021 - September 2021*

Involved in research at the UCF Center for Research on Computer Vision on multi-object tracking, mainly focusing on self-supervised learning for multi-object tracking.



## Industry Experience

### Senior Machine Learning Researcher

**[Bitdefender](https://bit-ml.github.io)** *2024 - Present*

Developing novel approaches for domain generalization and bias detection and prevention. Currently focusing on improving the generalization capabilities of fine-tuned foundation models.


### Head of AI

**[Vatis Tech](https://vatis.tech/)** *2023 - 2024*

Research and development for complete Automatic Speech Recognition systems: multi-lingual transcription, word-level timestamps, speaker diarization, real-time inference (stream processing). Most notably: developed a transcription system capable of transcribing audios featuring multiple languages and real-time language switches, proposed and developed a novel end-to-end speaker diarization deep learning model capable of real-time performance.


### Machine Learning Research and Development

**[Sparktech Software](https://sparktech.ro/)** *2017 - 2020*

Worked on an Automated Vouchering Tool. The project aimed at extracting data from invoices and invoice-like documents in order to be compared to a General Ledger. Invoices did not come in any predefined templates or structures. My contribution included research and development on many deep learning sub-projects such as: signature detection and matching, logo detection and matching, page deskewing and handwritten number extraction. I’ve also coordinated the research and development for an Explainable AI platform hosted on the cloud. As part of the research done for this project I have proposed a novel exemplar synthetization framework which can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03896).
