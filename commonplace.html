                    Creating physical, emotional, and mental space by focusing on natural needs, enjoying unnecessary pursuits in moderation, and avoiding or very rarely pursuing unnatural desires. Natural needs have clear limits. You can only eat so much food before you're no longer hungry. You can only drink so much water before you're no longer thirsty. You need only so much warmth before you're no longer cold. There’s only so much a shelter has to provide in order to shelter you. Take time to notice the peace that comes when hunger is gone and thirst is satisfied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Natural desires can be pursued in unnecessary ways. You can drink soda to quench your thirst. You can eat highly processed foods to end your hunger. However, these actions often have unwanted effects on your physical and mental wellbeing, and they can create new cravings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unnatural desires—those not needed for survival, such as the desire for luxury, fame, excessive money, exotic travel, or endless social media scrolling—have no natural limit. There's always thirst for more money. There's always a need to acquire more fame, to impress more people, to gain ever more praise and maintain your reputation. There's always a craving to scroll more. Engaging in unnatural pursuits means choosing to remain forever thirsty.

                    My house does not have to be a palace—it just has to be safe, clean, and welcoming. The way I dress does not have to be fancy—it just has to be neat. I don't need elaborate foods and drinks—I just need something nutritious and reasonably tasty. I don't need to scroll through social media for hours each day—I just need to meet with friends once a week. I don't need to spend hours browsing YouTube and random news to stay informed—I just need to check a few highly curated sources once a week or two.

                    At least eight hours. Keeping a steady schedule. No light or sound, to the best degree possible. Being careful with liquid intake before sleep to prevent nighttime wake-ups. Relaxing bedtime routine: stretching, tea, and a calming book. If I can't sleep, I simply read until I feel very tired, using an e-reader with very warm and dim backlight, lights off, to encourage sleepiness.

The current implementation involves two zone 2 cardio sessions and one HIIT cardio session, all on elliptical bike. Aside from the cardio sessions I engage in four resistance training sessions centered around compound movements: push-ups, pull-ups/chin-ups, squats, and core strengthening. All sessions are 20 minutes.

                <p>The practice of simply being: just sitting, just breathing, just walking—without desire or expectation.</p>
                <p>(i) Sit, ideally facing a wall, (ii) with open eyes, looking a short distance ahead, (iii) in a position where you won't fall asleep, while (iv) belly breathing. Ideally for at least 20 minutes.</p>
                <p>Whenever a thought captures your attention, neither push it away nor entertain it. The desire to have no desire is still a desire. The expectation to have no thoughts in your mind is still an expectation. When derailed, simply return to just sitting with your bones and muscles, letting the thought pass along. A good analogy is the sky, which lets clouds pass by without interfering, without identifying with any of them, without attaching to any of them, and without pushing any of them away.</p>
                <p>As it may be very difficult to realize when you have drifted into thought, you may count your breath. While focusing on your belly, count your inhale as 1, your exhale as 2, and so on until 10, then start again. Let your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations just be, and continue to count your breath. When you overcount or lose count, simply start again from 1—this is great, it means you've noticed a mental drift. The goal is the practice of returning to just breathing itself. Nothing more.</p>
                <p>Whenever you have time throughout the day, return to your breath, even for one breath. Or return to just walking if you are walking. Count your steps the same way you would count your breath, while focusing on your feet.</p>
                <p>As an alternative to Zazen, I highly recommend Prajna, as described by John Vervaeke here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdL9Yd0lB_k&list=PLND1JCRq8VujAHvDA482SXF1cJTQrwlx3">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdL9Yd0lB_k&list=PLND1JCRq8VujAHvDA482SXF1cJTQrwlx3</a>.</p>

                        After the Japanese attack on the American base at Pearl Harbor, circumstances obliged the disciple and his master to part company. "We will certainly lose the war,” Kodo Sawaki said at their leave-taking. “Our homeland will be destroyed, our people annihilated ... and this may be the last time we see one another. Nevertheless, love all mankind regardless of race or creed.”

                    <p>— Excerpt from Taisen Deshimaru's "The Voice of the Valley"</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>"Beings are numberless, I vow to free them." The first bodhisattva vow speaks to freeing beings from suffering, through metta, karuna, and mudita: loving-kindness, compassion, and sympathetic joy.</p>
                <p>
                    Metta, i.e. loving-kindness, is beatifully described by John Vervake as the intention to realize the moreness of someone, in both senses of the word "realize": to discover and to make real. This means both (i) discovering that the other person is more than you thought, and (ii) helping their potential become real.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When making a presentation, don't think "I want to make a great impression." Think "I want to help these people by giving them useful information." Imagine your brother or close friend asking: "What have you learned from your experience? Please tell me so I can learn something and make my life better." Then think "I want to realize the moreness of that person" and respond with that spirit. When you aim to impress, you feel anxious—the focus is on you. When you aim to help others benefit from what you've discovered, you feel warm inside—the focus is on them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second, karuna—compassion. When someone becomes angry and won't listen to reason, realize that person is suffering. Instead of shouting back, help them vent. Ask them to tell you more. Accept that they suffered without agreeing with or encouraging their views. "I understand that was a miserable experience for you. Tell me more about it." Don't encourage their views by saying "Yes, they're total jerks." Simply respond with "I understand how you're feeling." When they try to convince you of something, gently redirect the converation back to expressing their feelings. Listen and accept the emotions as they are. If their views aren't challenged or encouraged—if the emotion is simply vented and accepted—the person will eventually calm down. After that happens, switch subjects, make tea for instance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Trying to convince an enraged person is useless and only makes them feel more misunderstood, leaving you both distressed. You can't rationally change their mind, but you can help them vent and feel better inside. Again, the focus shifts outside, from "I want to win this argument" to "I understand this person is suffering, and I can alleviate some of that suffering by listening compassionately." This leaves you with warmth inside and gives them a clearer mind, free of vented rage, alongside a most important sense of belonging and being understood.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, mudita—sympathetic joy. Whenever someone is joyful around you, take a moment to delight in their joy. Ask them to tell you more about what they're experiencing and feeling. With these three practices—metta, karuna, and mudita—you can transform any situation into a warming experience. Most importantly, don't forget to act towards yourself the same way you would act towards others: with kindness, compassion, and joy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This endeavor can be supported by the formal practice of metta. In the formal practice, you bring to mind one person or group of people. In general, you would consider in order: yourself, someone you love, someone neutral such as the clerk you have seen at the shop today, someone you dislike, humanity at large, all sentient beings, and finally all beings. After bringing the person or group to mind, softly address them with one loving thought, and then repeat that loving thought a number of times. You may use any juicy loving words you consider attractive and appropriate. Some general choices include: "I want to realize the moreness of X," "May X be safe," or "May X enjoy a peaceful life."
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a bracelet with wooden beads, and I repeat the phrase for each bead until I complete the entire bracelet, then move to the next person or group. I usually do this first thing in the morning, last thing in the evening, and whenever I find a minute or two during the day. The practice doesn't have to go through all the stages—one is enough. I'm always wearing the bracelet, which through my practice becomes a symbol and constant reminder of love, of metta, always filling my heart with warmth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, it is important to remember that practice is based on actions, not words. That's why I started with the lived examples first and presented the formal practice last. Remember that the most important thing is to act as a loving individual, and use the formal practice to nurture that love.

                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Masters like Dogen wrote extensively about finding Buddha-nature in everyday activities and dedicated an entire book to cooking. Practitioners also engage in sewing their own kesa (robe) and zabuton (meditation cushion). Sesshins (meditation retreats) usually consist of a combination of zazen, samu, and teisho (dharma talks). During samu, the community cleans, cooks, and tends to the dojo together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Practitioners engage in those activities in a lively manner, with their whole body and mind. Even simple actions are performed this way. For instance, when entering the dojo, practitioners don't just discard their shoes randomly—they take their shoes with both hands and place them in a designated spot mindfully. When handing something to another person, you don't just pass it with one hand while half-turned and looking away. You handle things with both hands, look at the person in front of you, mindfully pass the object, and if you are the receiver, you may even bow as thanks (gassho).
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is an anecdote that I really like, in which somebody asks the Buddha what he should do before enlightenment and the Buddha answered: "Chop wood, carry water." Then he asked what he should do after enlightenment. The Buddha again answered: "Chop wood, carry water." This is often summarized in what is currently my favorite quote: "Before enlightenment, chop wood carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water." It suggests that after enlightenment, the focus remains on the mundane tasks of daily life, but with newfound appreciation and awareness. Enlightenment doesn't take us away from ordinary life, but transforms how we experience it. Washing dishes or sweeping floors can be just as much spiritual practice as formal meditation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Approach these activities with the spirit of metta, and practice them the same way you would practice zazen—just cook, just clean, just be there for yourself and for the other.

        <h2>Some books</h2>
        <p>
            These are sorted in a curriculum. This first section contains only very short, easy to read books, covering the very basic principles: (i) the realization that the life full of wealth and fame alone is not meaningful, (ii) the very basics about cultivating loving relationships that are meaningful and (iii) the very basics of getting to know yourself, building a meaningful relationship with yourself and investigating your cognitive patterns.

        </ol>
        <p>
            This second section is a bit more in depth and technical, but still accesible and restricted to three books as well, covering the three layers: physical, emotional and mental. However, it should be mentioned that these books are not restricted to a specific domain, all of them aid in physical, emotional and mental health at the same time, they just come from different angles. The first tackles of course, physical health, the second goes a bit deeper into the impact of relationships and how to cultivate them, and the third is an introduction to Buddhist philosophy as a way of life.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>If I were to summarize everything I wrote here, it would be an adaptation of Kodo Sawaki's message to Taisen Deshimaru: "Life is full of suffering, and we make it worse with our foolishness, nevertheless, love humanity with all your heart." Similar to Viktor Frankl, I believe that amid all this suffering, we can engage in acts of caring that can bring meaning to our life and make life worth living. So when suffering occurs, we just continue our practice. As Dogen said: "Just practice."</p>
