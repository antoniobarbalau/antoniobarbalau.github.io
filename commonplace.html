        <h1>What do I do with my life?</h1>
            
        <h2>Practice</h2>

        <p>
            There can be no meaning of life because meaning is not a property of objects — a certain song may might be meaningful to me but it certainly won't be to a lot of people. Furthermore, it is also impossible for a subject to simply generate meaning. Rather, meaning emerges during the right interaction between a subject and an object. As a consequence, there is no meaning of life, but only meaning in life — in the way you interact with life, in the way you live your life. Thus, the question is not "What is the meaning of life?", but rather, "How can I live a life full of meaning?" The curcial difference is that the answer to the first question would have been a propositional one such as "The meaning of life is X", while the answer to the second question is a way of life that you actively engage in. As a memorable quote,
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                "There is no way to Nirvana, Nirvana is the way." — Thich Nhat Hanh  <br/>
                "There is no Nirvana outside of your practice." — Shunryu Suzuki, in "Zen mind. Beginner's mind."
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            There is no distant objective meaning of life X that you have to strive towards, but rather, each and every one of your interactions with life can be a meaningful one or not. There is no meaning other than the one you experience during your engagement in interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because meaning emerges during interactions, living a meaningful life involves moving away from a self-centered life directed at gaining — fortune, achievements, appraisal — towards engaging in a way of life focused on caring. At the core of a meaningful life is the shift from "How can the world be relevant to me?" — "How can I derive what I want from it? How can I make it fit my ideas?" — to "How can I be relevant to the world" — "How can I be relevant to myself, to others and to something that transcends me (e.g. a child, a form of art)?" This is a summary of John Vervaeke's research on meaning in life. So the answer to the question "What do I do with my life?" is "Constant engagement in the practice of taking care of myself, others and the world at large." Here are a few points of practice.

                    Masters like Dogen wrote extensively about finding Buddha-nature in everyday activities and dedicated an entire book to cooking. Practitioners also engage in sewing their own kesa (robe) and zabuton (meditation cushion). Sesshins (meditation retreats) usually consist of a combination of zazen, samu, and teisho (dharma talks). During samu, the community cleans, cooks, and tends to the dojo together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Practitioners engage in those activities in a lively manner, with their whole body and mind. Even simple actions are performed this way. For instance, when entering the dojo, practitioners don't just discard their shoes randomly—they take their shoes with both hands and place them in a designated spot mindfully. When handing something to another person, you don't just pass it with one hand while half-turned and looking away. You handle things with both hands, look at the person in front of you, mindfully pass the object, and if you are the receiver, you may even bow as thanks (gassho).
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is an anecdote that I really like, in which somebody asks the Buddha what he should do before enlightenment and the Buddha answered: "Chop wood, carry water." Then he asked what he should do after enlightenment. The Buddha again answered: "Chop wood, carry water." This is often summarized in what is currently my favorite quote: "Before enlightenment, chop wood carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water." It suggests that after enlightenment, the focus remains on the mundane tasks of daily life, but with newfound appreciation and awareness. Enlightenment doesn't take us away from ordinary life, but transforms how we experience it. Washing dishes or sweeping floors can be just as much spiritual practice as formal meditation.

                <p>
                    Approach these activities with the spirit of metta, and practice them the same way you would practice zazen—just cook, just clean, just be there for yourself and for the other.

                    Creating physical, emotional, and mental space by focusing on natural needs, enjoying unnecessary pursuits in moderation, and avoiding or very rarely pursuing unnatural desires. Natural needs have clear limits. You can only eat so much food before you're no longer hungry. You can only drink so much water before you're no longer thirsty. You need only so much warmth before you're no longer cold. There's only so much a shelter has to provide in order to shelter you. Take time to notice the peace that comes when hunger is gone and thirst is satisfied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Natural desires can be pursued in unnecessary ways. You can drink soda to quench your thirst. You can eat highly processed foods to end your hunger. However, these actions often have unwanted effects on your physical and mental wellbeing, and they can create new cravings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unnatural desires—those not needed for survival, such as the desire for luxury, fame, excessive money, exotic travel, or endless social media scrolling—have no natural limit. There's always thirst for more money. There's always a need to acquire more fame, to impress more people, to gain ever more praise and maintain your reputation. There's always a craving to scroll more. Engaging in unnatural pursuits means choosing to remain forever thirsty.

                    The practice of simply being: just sitting, just breathing, just walking—without desire or expectation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (i) Sit, ideally facing a wall, (ii) with open eyes, looking a short distance ahead, (iii) in a position where you won't fall asleep, while (iv) belly breathing. Ideally for at least 20 minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whenever a thought captures your attention, neither push it away nor entertain it. The desire to have no desire is still a desire. The expectation to have no thoughts in your mind is still an expectation. When derailed, simply return to just sitting with your bones and muscles, letting the thought pass along. A good analogy is the sky, which lets clouds pass by without interfering, without identifying with any of them, without attaching to any of them, and without pushing any of them away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As it may be very difficult to realize when you have drifted into thought, you may count your breath. While focusing on your belly, count your inhale as 1, your exhale as 2, and so on until 10, then start again. Let your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations just be, and continue to count your breath. When you overcount or lose count, simply start again from 1—this is great, it means you've noticed a mental drift. The goal is the practice of returning to just breathing itself. Nothing more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I am privileged enough to have more time on my hand, I like to engage in a 1.5h practice session: 45mins zazen, 10min kinhin, 35min zazen. During kinhin, you walk half a foot at a time, moving your foot on the inhale and shifting your weight on the exhale, looking a short distance ahead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whenever you have time throughout the day, return to your breath, even for one breath. Whenever possible, return to just walking if you are walking. Count your steps the same way you would count your breath, while focusing on your feet. Whenever possible, return to simply savoring your tea, noticing all the sensations while just drinking your tea. Whenever possible, return to simply savoring the warmth of the sun.

                <p>
                    "Beings are numberless, I vow to free them." The first bodhisattva vow speaks to freeing beings from suffering, through metta, karuna, and mudita: loving-kindness, compassion, and sympathetic joy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Metta, i.e. loving-kindness, is beatifully described by John Vervake as the intention to realize the moreness of someone, in both senses of the word "realize": to discover and to make real. This means both (i) discovering that the other person is more than you thought, and (ii) helping their potential become real.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When making a presentation, don't think "I want to make a great impression." Think "I want to help these people by giving them useful information." Imagine your brother or close friend asking: "What have you learned from your experience? Please tell me so I can learn something and make my life better." Then think "I want to realize the moreness of that person" and respond with that spirit: "Hey, I've tried this and this, and this worked to this extent, and that worked to that extent. Finally, if you pursue a similar goal, it would be helpful to be very careful about this, and it may be useful to try this. I hope this is helpful to you, and if it is, I'm really glad that my experience aided someone who is passionate about the subject." When you aim to impress, you feel anxious—the focus is on you. When you aim to help others benefit from what you've discovered, you feel warm inside—the focus is on them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second, karuna—compassion. When someone becomes angry and won't listen to reason, realize that person is suffering. Instead of shouting back, help them vent. Ask them to tell you more. Accept that they suffered without agreeing with or encouraging their views. "I understand that was a miserable experience for you. Tell me more about it." Don't encourage their views by saying "Yes, they're total jerks." Simply respond with "I understand how you're feeling." When they try to convince you of something, gently redirect the converation back to expressing their feelings. Listen and accept the emotions as they are. If their views aren't challenged or encouraged—if the emotion is simply vented and accepted—the person will eventually calm down. After that happens, switch subjects, make tea for instance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Trying to convince an enraged person is useless and only makes them feel more misunderstood, leaving you both distressed. You can't rationally change their mind, but you can help them vent and feel better inside. Again, the focus shifts outside, from "I want to win this argument" to "I understand this person is suffering, and I can alleviate some of that suffering by listening compassionately." This leaves you with warmth inside and gives them a clearer mind, free of vented rage, alongside a most important sense of belonging and being understood.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, mudita—sympathetic joy. Whenever someone is joyful around you, take a moment to delight in their joy. Ask them to tell you more about what they're experiencing and feeling. With these three practices—metta, karuna, and mudita—you can transform any situation into a warming experience. Do so. And whenever you do so, take a moment to savor the feeling that you are experiencing. Most importantly, don't forget to act towards yourself the same way you would act towards others: with kindness, compassion, and joy.

                <p>
                    Real fun, as described by Catherine Price in "The Power of Fun"—based on an aggregating answers to questions along the lines of "When was the last time you felt like you really had fun?"—is playful connected flow. First, playfulness refers to engaging for the sake of the activity not for the sake of an outcome. If instead of playing tennis with a friend during the weekend, I would just receive a letter saying "Congratulations, you won!", I would not be satisfied. I want to play tennis because I like to play tennis—I don't want the outcome, I want the activity. This is a Zazen mentality, engaging in the activity for the sake of the activity. Second, the activity has to inspire a sense of connectedness, for instance: with someone, with your pet, with nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Flow is the state of being completely enmeshed with the activity to the point where you are not aware of the passing of time. It is a state of profound connectedness. Studies show that people who experience flow more often report their lives as being more meaningful. Aside from engaging in the activity for the sake of the activity—being fully present—there are a few conditions that you and the environment have to satisfy in order to make flow possible:<br/>
                    (i) The difficulty of the task should be just a bit above the limit of your abilities. This should prevent you from having the option to think about something else while engaged, while also assuring that you are not being crushed by the task in a way in which you can't move forward.<br/>
                    (ii) There should be an instant feedback loop between you and the environment—you quickly know if what you did was good or bad. This should keep you constantly engaged and constantly adapting.<br/>
                    (iii) Error has to matter. In rock climbing, if you make the wrong move you fall. This is yet a third mechanism required to keep you engaged.<br/>

                    This point of practice is about establishing a fun hobby or consciously scheduling one or more fun sessions each week—sessions in which you truly feel like you're living life. The activities do not have to be complex, you can enter the flow state while playing with your dog or cracking jokes with friends. Don't make a job out of having fun, just have fun, allocate some time to enjoy life and get deeply involved into something you like.

                        So much at least I can confirm with confidence about any who have written or propose to write on these questions, pretending to a knowledge of the problems with which I am concerned, whether they claim to have learned from me or from others or to have made their discoveries from themselves: it is impossible, in my opinion, that they can have learned anything at all about the subject. There is no writing of mine about these matters, nor will there ever be one. For this knowledge is not something that can be put into words like other sciences; but after long-continued intercourse between teacher and pupil, in joint pursuit of the subject, suddenly, like light flashing forth when a fire is kindled, it is born in the soul and straightway nourishes itself. — Plato, 7th letter

                    <em>* Note: Intelligence is fixed but rationality is trainable. When reading, you can replace intelligence with rationality or capability. Furthermore, instead of adopting a growth mindset, think about adopting a caring mindset. As far as I can understand, the growth mindset is a part of the caring mindset—described at the beggining of the commonplace—applied towards yourself in one area of competence. For instance, in the growth mindset, instead of desiring to be praised for a skill, which would lead you to seek said praise and avoid challenges, you aim to develop that skill and thus you embrace challenges. Similarly, in the caring mindset, you're not thinking about "How can I derive more (praise) from the world?" but rather "How can I be relevant to myself (and others)?", that is, instead of desiring to be praised for a skill, you aim to care about yourself by engaging in activities which help you develop that skill—which is exactly what a growth oriented person would do. However, different from the growth mindset, the caring mindset is not just about development, but rather, it extends towards all areas of your life and towards other people as well—it includes, for intance, taking care of your teeth, cooking for the family and planting a tree. Learn about the growth mindset and the extend it to become a caring mindset.</em>

                        While being received in the house of a man who had devoted considerable care to his many possessions, while leaving only himself in utter neglect, Diogenes cleared his throat and looked around him, but instead of choosing any nearby spot, spat directly at the master of the house. And when the man grew angry and asked why he had done that, he said that he could see nothing in the house that had been so neglected as its owner. For every wall was adorned with wonderful paintings, and there were images of the gods on the floor portrayed in magnificent mosaics, and all the furniture was bright and clean, and the coverings and couches were beautifully adorned, leaving their owner as the sole thing there that could be seen to have been neglected; and it is the universal custom in human society to spit in the worst place available.

                    I'm currenly keeping track of: sleep time and duration, water intake, what I eat, what type of workouts I engage in each day, how much I practice zazen each day, how much I've read and from what, finances and my 30-day dopamine fasting periods. I like to record these by hand in physical notebooks, the slow physical process makes me more aware of what I'm writing. I don't aim to hit certain goals, I just take note to become more counscious of what I am doing in these areas.

                        Cleanthes would never have been the image of Zeno if he had merely heard him lecture; he lived with him, studied his private life, watched him to see if he lived in accordance with his own principle. Plato, Aristotle and a host of other philosophers all destined to take different paths, derived more from Socrates' character than from his words. It was not Epicurus' school but living under the same roof as Epicurus that turned Metrodorus, Hermarchus and Polyaenus into great men. And yet I do not summon you to my side solely for the sake of your own progress but for my own as well, for we shall be of the utmost benefit to each other. — Senecta, to Lucilium (Letters from a Stoic)
