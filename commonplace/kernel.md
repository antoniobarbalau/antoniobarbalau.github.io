## Practice

### Physical

1. **Sleep**
   
    > "The day starts with evening Zazen and sleep is part of 24h practice." - Kosho Uchiyama

    At least eight hours. Keeping a steady schedule. No light or sound, to the best degree possible. Being careful with liquid intake before going to sleep in order to prevent wake-ups during the night. Relaxing routine before bed: tea and a book. If I can't sleep I just read Zen books until I get very tired. I'm using an e-reader with very warm and very dim backlight, and read with lights shut off, in order to get into the sleepy mood.


2. **Diet**

    > *We reflect on the effort that brought us this food and consider how it comes to us.*  
    > *We reflect on our virtue and practice, and whether we are worthy of this offering.*  
    > *We regard greed as the obstacle to freedom of mind.*  
    > *We regard this meal as medicine to sustain our life.*  
    > *For the sake of enlightenment we now receive this food.*
    > 
    > "We chant this verse to remind ourselves that eating is a spiritual practice, not just a way to fill our stomachs and satisfy our desires. We acknowledge that we eat to support our life, but also affirm the important spiritual meaning of the meal. We eat to keep this body in good shape and also to renew our bodhi-mind, our aspirations to practice according to the Buddha's teaching."

    Food cooked at home, as unprocessed as possible. At least 1.4g of protein per kg per day. At least 24g of high quality protein per meal. A healthy dose of vegetables and other sources of micronutrients. No sugar. No alcohol.

4. **Exercise**

5. **Space**

    Creating physical, emotional and mental space by focusing on natural needs, engaging in unnecessary pursuits in moderation, and avoiding or very rarely pursuing unnatural desires. Natural desires, needed for healthy life, have a natural limit. There only so much food you need to eat before you don’t feel hungry anymore. There’s only so much water you need to drink before you don’t feel thirsty anymore. There’s only so much heat you need before you don’t feel cold anymore. There’s only so much a shelther has to provide in order to shelter you. I find it blissful to engage in noticing the peacefulness coming from the lack of hunger and the lack of thirst for example.  

    But natural desires can be pursued in unncessary ways. You can drink coke to clench your thirst. You can go out and eat highly processed foods in order to end your hunger. However, these types of actions can have undesired effects on your physical and mental wellbeing.  

    Unnatural (not needed for survival) desires, such as the desire for luxury, fame, excessive amounts of money, fancy trips, the desire to scroll through social media, don’t have a natural limit. There’s always thirst for more money, I know people who are sad and feel like they need to work more because they can’t afford a winter house on a tropical island like some of their friends have. There’s always a need to acquire more fame, to impress more people, to acquire ever more praise and to maintain your reputation. There’s always a craving to scroll more.  

    My house does not have to be a palace, it just has to be safe, clean and welcoming. The way I dress does not have to be fancy, it just has to be trim. I don’t need fancy foods and drinks, I just need something nutritious that’s a bit tasty. I don’t need to scroll through social media for 3 hours a day, I just need meet with friends once a week. I don’t need to scroll through youtube and random news for 3 hours day in order to get information, I just need to check a few sources of highly curated information once a week or two.
