## Practice

### Physical

1. Sleep
> "The day starts with evening Zazen and sleep is part of 24h practice." - Kosho Uchiyama..
At least eight hours. Keeping a steady schedule. No light or sound, to the best degree possible. Being careful with liquid intake before going to sleep in order to prevent wake-ups during the night. Relaxing routine before bed: tea and a book. If I can't sleep I just read Zen books until I get very tired. I'm using an e-reader with very warm and very dim backlight, and read with lights shut off, in order to get into the sleepy mood.

2. Eating..
Food cooked at home, as unprocessed as possible. At least 1.4g of protein per kg per day. At least 24g of high quality protein per meal. A healthy dose of vegetables and other sources of micronutrients. No sugar. No alcohol.

3. Sport
