## Practice

### Physical

1. **Sleep**
   
    > "The day starts with evening Zazen and sleep is part of 24h practice." - Kosho Uchiyama

    At least eight hours. Keeping a steady schedule. No light or sound, to the best degree possible. Being careful with liquid intake before going to sleep in order to prevent wake-ups during the night. Relaxing routine before bed: tea and a book. If I can't sleep I just read Zen books until I get very tired. I'm using an e-reader with very warm and very dim backlight, and read with lights shut off, in order to get into the sleepy mood.


2. **Diet**

    > *We reflect on the effort that brought us this food and consider how it comes to us.*  
    > *We reflect on our virtue and practice, and whether we are worthy of this offering.*  
    > *We regard greed as the obstacle to freedom of mind.*  
    > *We regard this meal as medicine to sustain our life.*  
    > *For the sake of enlightenment we now receive this food.*
    > 
    > "We chant this verse to remind ourselves that eating is a spiritual practice, not just a way to fill our stomachs and satisfy our desires. We acknowledge that we eat to support our life, but also affirm the important spiritual meaning of the meal. We eat to keep this body in good shape and also to renew our bodhi-mind, our aspirations to practice according to the Buddha's teaching."
    > 
    > -- Shohaku Okumura, in "Living by Vow"
   
    Food cooked at home, as unprocessed as possible. At least 1.4g of protein per kg per day. At least 24g of high quality protein per meal. A healthy dose of vegetables and other sources of micronutrients. No sugar. No alcohol.

3. **Exercise**


    > Crates was in the habit of running a certain distance each day, and would say, "I'm running for the sake of my spleen, for the sake of my liver, for the sake of my stomach."  
    > He was ugly to behold, and when he carried out his exercises, people would laugh at him. As he raised his arms, he used to say to himself, "Courage now, Crates, this is for the good of your eyes and of your whole body; and there will come a day when you will see these people, who are now laughing at you, become shrivelled up by illness, and then they will account you happy and reproach themselves for their idleness!"
    >

4. **Space**

    Creating physical, emotional and mental space by focusing on natural needs, engaging in unnecessary pursuits in moderation, and avoiding or very rarely pursuing unnatural desires. Natural desires, needed for healthy life, have a natural limit. There only so much food you need to eat before you don’t feel hungry anymore. There’s only so much water you need to drink before you don’t feel thirsty anymore. There’s only so much heat you need before you don’t feel cold anymore. There’s only so much a shelther has to provide in order to shelter you. I find it blissful to engage in noticing the peacefulness coming from the lack of hunger and the lack of thirst for example.  

    But natural desires can be pursued in unncessary ways. You can drink coke to clench your thirst. You can go out and eat highly processed foods in order to end your hunger. However, these types of actions can have undesired effects on your physical and mental wellbeing.  

    Unnatural (not needed for survival) desires, such as the desire for luxury, fame, excessive amounts of money, fancy trips, the desire to scroll through social media, don’t have a natural limit. There’s always thirst for more money, I know people who are sad and feel like they need to work more because they can’t afford a winter house on a tropical island like some of their friends have. There’s always a need to acquire more fame, to impress more people, to acquire ever more praise and to maintain your reputation. There’s always a craving to scroll more.  

    My house does not have to be a palace, it just has to be safe, clean and welcoming. The way I dress does not have to be fancy, it just has to be trim. I don’t need fancy foods and drinks, I just need something nutritious that’s a bit tasty. I don’t need to scroll through social media for 3 hours a day, I just need meet with friends once a week. I don’t need to scroll through youtube and random news for 3 hours day in order to get information, I just need to check a few sources of highly curated information once a week or two.



## General outline

### Knowledge

Having things (including abilities, physical or mental traits, etc.) is useless if you don't know how to use them and damaging if you don't use them rightly. In order to use them rightly knowledge is required. You can burrow it in some scenarios, but in most scenarios, especially those specific to your particularities, you have to generate the knowledge yourself via understanding.

### Understanding

I would say that the trajectory of a falling rock is grounded in the laws of physics. And that the same laws of physics explain the trajectory of every falling rock. I would say someone understands how rocks fall, if he is able to model these laws of physics which ground and explain the trajectories of falling rocks. And as proof that he modeled them rightly, as proof that he understands how rocks fall, he would be able to generate, simulate or predict trajectories of falling rocks, using his model which approximates the laws. Because of our understanding of how things move, you are not allowed to place bets at the roulette once the ball has been launched.

It is important to note the two properties that the laws of physics manifest with regard to the falling rocks: they ground and they explain. It is important to note that the trajectories of falling rocks are grounded in the laws of physics, to note that the laws of physics manifest themselves in the trajectory of every falling rock, because noting this enables us to model these laws. That is, since the laws of physics manifest themselves in the trajectory of every rock, we can model them by abstracting out that which is common among a large set of instances of rocks being thrown. And it is important to note that these laws of nature explain the trajectories of falling rocks, and use that as a criteria to validate our understanding. That is, our understanding (our model) is as good inasmuch as it can explain (or generate or simulate or predict) the trajectories of falling rocks.

### Nature

Now, it seems to me very desirable to push this to the max: model that which grounds and explains every thing, so we can understand everything. For the purposes of the current work, I will refer to that which grounds and explains every thing, the nature of all things, as Nature. Let's reiterate the two properties it features:

1. Nature grounds every thing. Every thing is grounded in Nature. Nature partakes in everything. Nature manifests itself in every thing; the same way the laws of physics (the laws of Nature) manifest themselves in the trajectory of every falling rock, the same way the psychological archetype of Anger manifests itself through every angry individual, the same way biological evolution manifests itself in every adapted species. Nature is that which is common among all things.

2. Since Nature is that which explains all things, it is not itself any thing. Note how, that which grounds and explains all trajectories of falling rocks, is not itself a trajectory of a rock which is falling, but rather, the laws of physics. That which grounds and explains all instances of people being angry, is not an instance of someone being angry, but a psychological archetype. That which grounds and explains all adaptive features, such as quickness or wit, is not itself and adaptive feature such as quickness or wit, it is the process of biological evolution. Similarly, that which grounds and explains all things, is not itself a thing; it is that which grounds and explains all those things, it is not any of those things, it is that which grounds and explains them.

Let me dwell on this last point because I find it so awesome. That which grounds and explains all beings is not itself any being. That which grounds and explains all phenomena is not itself a phenomena. That which grounds and explains all ideas is not itself an idea. That which grounds and explains both good and bad is not itself good or bad, it is that which grounds and explains both of them. That which grounds and explains all things which are caused is not itself a thing which is caused. That which grounds and explains all things which observe and all things which are observed is not something which observes or something which is observed. That which grounds and explains all intelligible things is not itself an intelligible thing. So you can never get to know it.


## Book List

These sorted in a curriculum. This first section contain only very short, easy to read books, covering the very basic principles: (i) the realization that the life full of wealth and fame alone is not meaningful, (ii) the very basics about cultivating loving relationships that are meaningful and (iii) the very basics of getting to know yourself, building a meaningful relationship with yourself and investigating your cognitive patterns.

1. The Death of Ivan Ilyich - Leo Tolstoy
2. True Love - Thich Nhat Hanh
3. The power of focusing - Ann Weiser Cornell

This second section is a bit more in depth and technical, but restricted to three books as well, covering the three layers: physical, emotional and mental. However, it should be mentioned that these books are not restricted to a specific domain, all of them aid in physical, emotional and mental health at the same time, they just come from different angles. The first tackles of course, physical health, the second goes a bit deeper into the impact of relationships and how to cultivate them, and the third is an introduction to Buddhist philosophy as a way of life.

1. Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body - Andrew Huberman
2. The Good Life: Lessons from the World's Longest Scientific Study of Happiness - Robert Waldinger
3. The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching - Thich Nhat Hanh

This last section is very in depth, technical, and at points mystical. I did my best to sort them in an order which introduces concepts gradually, such that the mysticism is reduced as much as possible. However, some might still be very hard to grasp without exposure to other materials able to clarify some of the concepts, historical background, etc. If I had to point out a single resource, I would recommend John Vervaeke's work (Awakening from the Meaning Crisis, After Socrates, The God of Einstein and Spinoza, The Philosophical Silkroad, and some of the presentations and conversations he featured on his channel) to fill in these gaps and provide the neccessary background.

1. John Vervaeke - Awakening from the Meaning Crisis
2. What is ancient philosophy? - Pierre Hadot
3. The inner citadel - Pierre Hadot
4. The Wisdom of Hypatia - Bruce J MacLennan
5. Opening the hand of thought - Kosho Uchiyama
6. Living by vow - Shohaku Okumura
7. Plato - Complete works -- Maybe starting with Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, Phaedo, Meno, Lysis, Charmides, Laches, Alcibaldes, Symposium
8. Dialectic and Dialogue: Plato's Practice of Philosophical Inquiry - Francisco Gonzalez
