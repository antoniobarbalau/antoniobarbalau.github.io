## Knowledge

Having things (including abilities, physical or mental traits, etc.) is useless if you don't know how to use them and damaging if you don't use them rightly. In order to use them rightly knowledge is required. You can burrow it in some scenarios, but in most scenarios, especially those specific to your particularities, you have to generate the knowledge yourself via understanding.


## Understanding

I would say that the trajectory of a falling rock is grounded in the laws of physics. And that the same laws of physics explain the trajectory of every falling rock. I would say someone understands how rocks fall, if he is able to model these laws of physics which ground and explain the trajectories of falling rocks. And as proof that he modeled them rightly, as proof that he understands how rocks fall, he would be able to generate, simulate or predict trajectories of falling rocks, using his model which approximates the laws. Because of our understanding of how things move, you are not allowed to place bets at the roulette once the ball has been launched.

It is important to note the two properties that the laws of physics manifest with regard to the falling rocks: they ground and they explain. It is important to note that the trajectories of falling rocks are grounded in the laws of physics, to note that the laws of physics manifest themselves in the trajectory of every falling rock, because noting this enables us to model these laws. That is, since the laws of physics manifest themselves in the trajectory of every rock, we can model them by abstracting out that which is common among a large set of instances of rocks being thrown. And it is important to note that these laws of nature explain the trajectories of falling rocks, and use that as a criteria to validate our understanding. That is, our understanding (our model) is as good inasmuch as it can explain (or generate or simulate or predict) the trajectories of falling rocks.


## Nature

Now, it seems to me very desirable to push this to the max: model that which grounds and explains every thing, so we can understand everything. For the purposes of the current work, I will refer to that which grounds and explains every thing, the nature of all things, as Nature. Let's reiterate the two properties it features:

1. Nature grounds every thing. Every thing is grounded in Nature. Nature partakes in everything. Nature manifests itself in every thing; the same way the laws of physics (the laws of Nature) manifest themselves in the trajectory of every falling rock, the same way the psychological archetype of Anger manifests itself through every angry individual, the same way biological evolution manifests itself in every adapted species. Nature is that which is common among all things.
   
2. Since Nature is that which explains all things, it is not itself any thing. Note how, that which grounds and explains all trajectories of falling rocks, is not itself a trajectory of a rock which is falling, but rather, the laws of physics. That which grounds and explains all instances of people being angry, is not an instance of someone being angry, but a psychological archetype. That which grounds and explains all adaptive features, such as quickness or wit, is not itself and adaptive feature such as quickness or wit, it is the process of biological evolution. Similarly, that which grounds and explains all things, is not itself a thing; it is that which grounds and explains all those things, it is not any of those things, it is that which grounds and explains them.

Let me dwell on this last point because I find it so awesome. That which grounds and explains all beings is not itself any being. That which grounds and explains all phenomena is not itself a phenomena. That which grounds and explains all ideas is not itself an idea. That which grounds and explains both good and bad is not itself good or bad, it is that which grounds and explains both of them. That which grounds and explains all things which are caused is not itself a thing which is caused. That which grounds and explains all things which observe and all things which are observed is not something which observes or something which is observed. That which grounds and explains all intelligible things is not itself an intelligible thing. So you can never get to know it.


## Goals

Maybe we don't need to understand everything, maybe we just need to understand how to act in order to fulfil our goal. But what goal? Minimizing pain would be a straight answer. However, if I really just wanted to avoid pain I would sit in my room all day. I don't do that, and nobody I know does that. I also like to practice sports and eat at restaurants. I also like to experience pleasure. So the goal might be to minimize pain while maximizing pleasure. However, there is no straightforward way to do that. Again, if I want to experience the pleasure of reaching the top of a mountain, I have to undergo significant physical hardship and pain while exposing myself to the risk of facing a bear in the wild. If I want to avoid future pain by undergoing a medical treatment, consisting in a surgery, going through recovery and following a restricted diet for a while, that certainly isn't pleasureable. In some circumstances I can optimize both goals, but often one of the goals can only be optimized at the expense of the other. And I've found no clear way to balance them as of yet.

And we've not yet considered the desire to survive and reproduce. That comes in conflict both with minimizing pain and with maximizing pleasure. The clearest example I can think of is having a child. Raising a child, as far as I've been informed, is far from pleasurable and it can be very physically and mentally demanding. You don't get to sleep well, you don't get to eat well, you're sick all the time, your finances take a hit, vacations are not an option anymore and there's a lot of added responsibility. Aside from optimizing pain, pleasure and survival there's also the need to live a meaningful life. You may want to stand up for what is right in the face of adversity, but that may come at the cost of reduced pleasure, increased pain and a reduced chance of survival. Pursuing any vocation seriously requires significant effort and can be physically and mentally demanding while stripping away the time you could dedicate to your family and to pleasureable activities.

As far as I understand myself, I don't have a clear goal. Sometimes I choose to undergo pain in order to experience pleasure. Sometime I sacrifice pleasure in order to avoid pain. Sometimes I voluntarily give up pleasure and undergo pain in order to survive. Sometimes I take risks that threaten my survival in order to experience pleasure or to avoid pain. Sometimes I engage in meaningful pursuits at the expense of all other goals. Sometimes I give up on meaningful pursuits so that I can focus on surviving and avoiding pain. So, I can never understand Nature, I can never understand everything. I though I could understand how to reach my goal, but I can't define my goal, I have multiple conflicting goals.


## Transjectivity

Let's suppose for a moment that I don't have multiple conflicting goals. Let's suppose I have a single goal and let's try to optimize that. For simple goals, such as making a cup of coffee, a procedure and easily be optimized. However, for more encompassing goals, such as being a loving individual, there is no procedure that one can follow.

1. The way you manifest your love towards your wife is different from the way you should manifest your love for your child. Both of these, in turn are different from the way you would manifest love towards a coworker; you would not kiss your coworker goodnight. Love also manifests in completely different ways towards your parents, people on the street, brothers and sisters, other relatives, the cashier you interact with, money, fame, your pet, some work of art, etc.
 
2. Within the context of a single individual, sometimes you have to be accepting, to let the other manifest the way it finds suitable, e.g. let your friend pursue a career he would love but you'd not consider optimal. At other times however, you have to push against the other, in order to prevent him from damaging himself, e.g. prevent your friend from doing drugs.

3. Even if you consider the very restricted case, of tackling a single specific context with regards to a single specific individual, e.g. eating dinner with your wife, the answer is still not a procedural one. You can't do the same thing forever. Sometimes you may tell jokes during the dinner, but she will soon grow tired of your jokes, hence, at times, you might want to discuss other things, or propose to eat out, or look at old pictures together and discuss them while eating.

It is impossible to optimize such a procedure, because for a given subject (in this case, you), the procedure has to at least be optimized to encompass all objects with which the subject interacts, across all circumstances and across all moments in time. It is impossible to even list all those scenarios, let alone optimize for all of them. And this is if you want to pursue optimizing love for a single subject (in this case, for you), if you want to optimize a form of manifesting love which works for all subjects, that adds a whole other degree of complexity. Because of love's transjectivity, it can never be fully articulated or understood. Love is just an example, there is a plethora of similar goals. To list a handful: to be a good cook, to be a good musician, to be a good programmer, to be a good mathematician, to be a good writer.

So, I can never understand Nature, I can never understand everything. I though I could understand how to reach my goal, but I can't define my goal, I have multiple conflicting goals. And on top of that, now I've found out that even if I did chose to focus on a single goal such as being a loving individual, there's no way in which I could every properly optimize it anyway.


## Relevance Realization

even if you only chose a single subject a single object a single situation at a single point in time, there's the issue that realizing what is relevant and that cannot be computed, so you're always biased and susceptible to self destructive self-deceptive behavior.


## Computational Irreducibility

Even if you did know all the relevant factors, there's computational irreducibility.


___

The way I see it now, we're just finite computational machines making miss-informed short-sighted poorly-optimized decisions towards ambiguous goals conflicting both internally and externally.



## Transcendence through dialogue

Though you can never attain perfection in any of such encompassing goals, you can always, to some degree, transcend your current limitations in understanding through dialogue. My cognitive framework is transparent to me because I'm looking through it, not at it (the way you can only look through your eyes and not at your eyes without external help), but a different individual can look at it (because he's on the outside) instead of through it (like I do) and notice its limitations. Furthermore, the other individual is able to supply my computational finitude and limited experience with his computational power and experience. In time, you may be able to internalize the perspective of your dialogue partner and use that to internally challenge some points without needing assistance save for rare circumstances.
