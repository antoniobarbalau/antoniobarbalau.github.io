### Making Space

Creating physical, emotional and mental space by focusing on natural needs, engaging in unnecessary pursuits in moderation, and avoiding or very rarely pursuing unnatural desires.

Natural desires, needed for healthy life, have a natural limit. There only so much food you need to eat before you don't feel hungry anymore. There's only so much water you need to drink before you don't feel thirsty anymore. There's only so much heat you need before you don't feel cold anymore. There's only so much a shelther has to provide in order to shelter you. I find it blissful to engage in noticing the peacefulness coming from the lack of hunger and the lack of thirst for example.

But natural desires can be pursued in unncessary ways. You can drink coke to clench your thirst. You can go out and eat highly processed foods in order to end your hunger. However, these types of actions can have undesired effects on your physical and mental wellbeing.

Unnatural (not needed for survival) desires, such as the desire for luxury, fame, excessive amounts of money, fancy trips, the desire to scroll through social media, don't have a natural limit. There's always thirst for more money, I know people who are sad and feel like they need to work more because they can't afford a winter house on a tropical island like some of their friends have. There's always a need to acquire more fame, to impress more people, to acquire ever more praise and to maintain your reputation. There's always a craving to scroll more.

My house does not have to be a palace, it just has to be safe, clean and welcoming. The way I dress does not have to be fancy, it just has to be trim. I don't need fancy foods and drinks, I just need something nutritious that's a bit tasty. I don't need to scroll through social media for 3 hours a day, I just need meet with friends once a week. I don't need to scroll through youtube and random news for 3 hours day in order to get information, I just need to check a few sources of highly curated information once a week or two.

## Emotional

### Spending time with ourself without desire or expectations

I like to do this in the form of written illeism. Narrating my thoughts, emotions and physical sensations alongside the things which happen to my from a third person perspective without expectations or desires, as matter-of-fact as possible. Just spending time to listen to everything that wants to get out.

E.g. "A part of Antonio is anxious. A part of Antonio is angry that he gets so emotional, because it thinks it impedes the preparation for tomorrow."

Wrong: "Antonio is stupid." Right: "A part of Antonio thinks that he is stupid."

Wrong: "Antonio is procrastinating." Right: "Antonio feels anxious. This is mainly due to the presentation tomorrow. He feels a tightness in his chest and his palms are sweating. He looks at cat videos to distract himself from his feeelings. A part of him is angry at this behavior and labels it as procrastination."

### Savoring

Engaging in (20 min) savoring vacantions as described in chapters 1 and 8 of "Savoring: A New Model of Positive Experience" by Fred B Bryant and Joseph Veroff.

### Fun hobby

**Fun:** Playful Connected Flow.

**Playful:** Engaging for the sake of the activity not for the sake of an outcome.

**Connected:** It has to inspire a sense of connectedness (e.g. with someone, with your pet, with Nature etc.).

**Flow:**
- The environment:
	1. The task should be at the limit of your abilities, such that you don't have the option to think about something else, while neither being crushed by the task such that you can't move forward.
	2. Instant feedback loop. You quickly know if what you did was good or bad, keeps you engaged and connected.
	3. Error matters (e.g. if you make a misstep at rock climbing you fall and break the run). Keeps you going and engaged.
- You:
	1. Have to give it your all, get completely engaged in the process.
	2. Give up desire and expectation for the duration of the process, as these will break your concetration. Desire is a contract with yourself to be miserable until the object of your desire has been achieved. Expectation is a contract with yourself to be miserable from now on because your expectations have not been met. They will both keep you busy with things unrelated to making the next step in your activity.


### Consciously engaging in acts of self-care

Cooking for yourself as a nurturing act towards yourself. Taking time to clean your room as a gesture of care for yourself. Taking care of your health as an act of kindness directed towards yourself.


## Mental
### Internalizing Socrates

> So much at least I can confirm with confidence about any who have written or propose to write on these questions, pretending to a knowledge of the problems with which I am concerned, whether they claim to have learned from me or from others or to have made their discoveries from themselves: it is impossible, in my opinion, that they can have learned anything at all about the subject. There is no writing of mine about these matters, nor will there ever be one. For this knowledge is not something that can be put into words like other sciences; but after long-continued intercourse between teacher and pupil, in joint pursuit of the subject, suddenly, like light flashing forth when a fire is kindled, it is born in the soul and straightway nourishes itself. -- Plato, 7th letter

> Cleanthes would never have been the image of Zeno if he had merely heard him lecture; he lived with him, studied his private life, watched him to see if he lived in accordance with his own principle. Plato, Aristotle and a host of other philosophers all destined to take different paths, derived more from Socrates' character then from his words. It was not Epicurus' school but living under the same roof as Epicurus that turned Metrodorus, Hermarchus and Polyaenus into great men. And yet I do not summon you to my side solely for the sake of your own progress but for my own as well, for we shall be of the utmost benefit to each other. -- Senecta, to Lucilium

To the best of my understanding, Plato offered us to opportunity to accompany Socrates on his daily affairs. The dialogues end, as expected, without a verbal conclusion due to the [tranjective](commonplace/dialogue.md) nature of the virtues. However, Socrates seems to manifest some form piety in Euthyphro, moderation in Charmides, courage in Laches and frienship in Lysis to give a few examples. But even without this, there is a profound love of wisdom expressed in Socrates' way of life. To me, this practice is about reading be transformed, not informed. Getting into Socrates' love of wisdom. Taking time to admire his relentless pursuit of understanding, taking to admire the way he never gets angry, but rather ever adapts his discourse to make himself understood better, always patient in the discussion. Reading slowly, focusing on the character behind the unfolding events, not on the words per se. Reading to get the perspective of Socrates, thinking about the mind that produced those words in that specific situation, trying to embody that mind, trying to get into Socrates' skin. Imagine what it is like to think like that, to say that in that situation.
