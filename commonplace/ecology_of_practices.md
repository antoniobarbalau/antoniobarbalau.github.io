### Making Space

Creating physical, emotional and mental space by focusing on natural needs, engaging in unnecessary pursuits in moderation, and avoiding or very rarely pursuing unnatural desires.

Natural desires, needed for healthy life, have a natural limit. There only so much food you need to eat before you don't feel hungry anymore. There's only so much water you need to drink before you don't feel thirsty anymore. There's only so much heat you need before you don't feel cold anymore. There's only so much a shelther has to provide in order to shelter you. I find it blissful to engage in noticing the peacefulness coming from the lack of hunger and the lack of thirst for example.

But natural desires can be pursued in unncessary ways. You can drink coke to clench your thirst. You can go out and eat highly processed foods in order to end your hunger. However, these types of actions can have undesired effects on your physical and mental wellbeing.

Unnatural (not needed for survival) desires, such as the desire for luxury, fame, excessive amounts of money, fancy trips, the desire to scroll through social media, don't have a natural limit. There's always thirst for more money, I know people who are sad and feel like they need to work more because they can't afford a winter house on a tropical island like some of their friends have. There's always a need to acquire more fame, to impress more people, to acquire ever more praise and to maintain your reputation. There's always a craving to scroll more.

My house does not have to be a palace, it just has to be safe, clean and welcoming. The way I dress does not have to be fancy, it just has to be trim. I don't need fancy foods and drinks, I just need something nutritious that's a bit tasty. I don't need to scroll through social media for 3 hours a day, I just need meet with friends once a week. I don't need to scroll through youtube and random news for 3 hours day in order to get information, I just need to check a few sources of highly curated information once a week or two.

## Emotional

### Just Sitting / Just Breathing
Sit and breathe with no desire or expectations. Rediscover the pleasure of simply being. This is the basis of love, the ability to just take the time to sit there with yourself, the ability to just sit there with whatever comes up in our mind, with whatever emotions comes up and with whatever physical sensation comes up. Just sit there with it, with no desire or expectations, without judging, just being there with it. Just sitting there with you as you are. Accepting yourself as you are. Just sitting there with the world as it is. Accepting the world as it is.  

(i) Sit, ideally, facing a wall, (ii) with eyes open looking a short distance ahead (but don't force it), (iii) in a position in which you won't fall asleep while (iv) belly breathing. Ideally for at least 20 mins.

Whenever a thought captures your attention, neither push it away, nor entertain it. The desire to have no desire is still a desire. The expectation to have no throughts is still an expectation. When derailed, simply return to just sitting with your bones and muscles, letting the tought continue in the background and do its thing. A good analogy is the sky which lets the clouds pass without interfering, without identifying with any of them, without attaching to any of them or pushing them away.

It may be very difficult to realize when you've drifted in thought. So, at first, you may meditate. When inhaling say in your mind "breathing in", when exhaling say "breathing out". Do not alter your breath, just follow and label it. Use any sentence you see fit. The words don't matter, what matters is using this as a mechanism to help you more easily realized when you get cought in a train of throught. When you notice you've not been labeling your breath, that's when you know you've drifted. Let the thoughts be, and simply and getly return to labeling your breath.

Alternatively, you can count your breath while trying to pay attention to the sensations in your belly. Let your thoughts be and count your breath. Whenever you realize you've skipped a number, or messed up the numbering, or forgot to count, or forgot where you were with the numbering, start again from 1 without judging yourself. If you start again, that's a good thing, it means you've noticed the drift. The goal is the practice (of returning when derailed) itself. Nothing else.

This could be done as a seated practice, but more importantly, all throughout the day. Whenever commuting or waiting for something, if there's nothing that needs thinking about explicitly, return to your breath, even for one breath.

### Savoring and Having Fun

Engaging in savoring as described in chapters 1 and 8 of "Savoring: A New Model of Positive Experience" by Fred B Bryant and Joseph Veroff.

**Fun:** Playful Connected Flow. (Catherine Price - The Power of Fun)

**Playful:** Engaging for the sake of the activity not for the sake of an outcome.

**Connected:** It has to inspire a sense of connectedness (e.g. with someone, with your pet, with Nature etc.).

**Flow:**
- The environment:
	1. The task should be at the limit of your abilities, such that you don't have the option to think about something else, while neither being crushed by the task such that you can't move forward.
	2. Instant feedback loop. You quickly know if what you did was good or bad, keeps you engaged and connected.
	3. Error matters (e.g. if you make a misstep at rock climbing you fall and break the run). Keeps you going and engaged.
- You:
	1. Have to give it your all, get completely engaged in the process.
	2. Give up desire and expectation for the duration of the process, as these will break your concetration. Desire is a contract with yourself to be miserable until the object of your desire has been achieved. Expectation is a contract with yourself to be miserable from now on because your expectations have not been met. They will both keep you busy with things unrelated to making the next step in your activity.


### Spending time with yourself

By talking and listening to yourself, by cooking for yourself, by cleaning the room for yourself. Engage in such actions as deliberate acts of caring about yourself and caring for yourself. Let each moment in which you are deliberately taking care of yourself feel heartwarming.

With regards to talking and listening to yourself, I like to do this in the form of written illeism. Spending time listening to myself without desire or expectation. Narrating my thoughts, emotions and physical sensations alongside the things which happen to my from a third person perspective without expectations or desires, as matter-of-fact as possible. Just spending time to listen to everything that wants to get out. Getting to know myself.

E.g. "A part of Antonio is anxious. A part of Antonio is angry that he gets so emotional, because it thinks it impedes the preparation for tomorrow."

Wrong: "Antonio is stupid." Right: "A part of Antonio thinks that he is stupid."

Wrong: "Antonio is procrastinating." Right: "Antonio feels anxious. This is mainly due to the presentation tomorrow. He feels a tightness in his chest and his palms are sweating. He looks at cat videos to distract himself from his feeelings. A part of him is angry at this behavior and labels it as procrastination."

### Values in action

Dedicating your life to a set of values which transcend you. Making each and every moment of your life meaningful by dedicating it to the values you have chosen. Each action is a meaningful one because it contributes to manifesting the values.


## Mental
### Spending time with sages

> So much at least I can confirm with confidence about any who have written or propose to write on these questions, pretending to a knowledge of the problems with which I am concerned, whether they claim to have learned from me or from others or to have made their discoveries from themselves: it is impossible, in my opinion, that they can have learned anything at all about the subject. There is no writing of mine about these matters, nor will there ever be one. For this knowledge is not something that can be put into words like other sciences; but after long-continued intercourse between teacher and pupil, in joint pursuit of the subject, suddenly, like light flashing forth when a fire is kindled, it is born in the soul and straightway nourishes itself. -- Plato, 7th letter

> Cleanthes would never have been the image of Zeno if he had merely heard him lecture; he lived with him, studied his private life, watched him to see if he lived in accordance with his own principle. Plato, Aristotle and a host of other philosophers all destined to take different paths, derived more from Socrates' character then from his words. It was not Epicurus' school but living under the same roof as Epicurus that turned Metrodorus, Hermarchus and Polyaenus into great men. And yet I do not summon you to my side solely for the sake of your own progress but for my own as well, for we shall be of the utmost benefit to each other. -- Senecta, to Lucilium

Spending time with people like Socrates, Seneca, Marcus Aurelius and Diogenes the Cynic. These writings are not treaties or academic papers, but rather, Socrates engaged in dialogue, Seneca wrote letters, Marcus spoke to himself and Diogenes lived a life that spoke for itself, which was captured in anecdotes. Each of those writings enables us to learn about their characters; in his way of writing, Plato offered us to opportunity to accompany Socrates on his daily affairs. This practice is about reading be transformed, not informed. Socrates seems to manifest some form piety in Euthyphro, moderation in Charmides, courage in Laches and frienship in Lysis to give a few examples. He always manifests patience with his interlocutors and speaks about himself in humble terms. He manifests a relentless pursuit of understanding. So when engaging with those works, the focus is not on the words per se, but rather on spending time with the characther and trying to get a feel for the character, trying to embody the mind that produced that response in that situation, given their conditions. Imagining what it is like to think like them. Reading Seneca's letters as if you were the recipient serves both as companionship and as mentorship. Philosophy as a way of life in the Stoic or Socratic sense has friendship at its core. Become friends with the sages.

My shortlist:
1.  Plato - Complete works
    - Maybe starting with Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, Phaedo, Meno, Lysis, Charmides, Laches, Alcibaldes, Symposium
	- Useful resource: "Dialectic and Dialogue: Plato's Practice of Philosophical Inquiry" - Francisco Gonzalez
3. Senecta - Letters to Lucilium (from a Stoic)
4. Marcus Aurelius - Meditations
5. Epictetus - Complete Works
6. Diogenes the Cynic: Sayings and Anecdotes, With Other Popular Moralists - Oxford World's Classics


### Engaging in philosophy as a way of life

Choosing one Epicurean/Cynic/Stoic/Neoplatonic exercise each week and focusing on it for that week.

### Therapy

CBT / IFS


## Social
### Work

Performing a job which helps contribute to society at large.


### Family

Spending time with family.

### Friends

Spending time with friends, ideally talking to them as you would to a therapist, listening to them as a therapist would, and engaging in fun activities. Engaging in a community in general. Your value system, your knowledge, your practices, cannot remain fixed, you need a community to keep adapting.


### Aiming to help not to gain

Approaching each situation with the desire to help as much as possible. When presenting, don't aim to impress, aim to deliver useful information to the others.
